less command in Linux with Examples
Less command is linux utility which can be used to read contents of text file one page(one screen) per time. It has faster access because if file is large, it don’t access complete file, but access it page by page.

For example, if it’s a large file and you are reading it using any text editor, then the complete file will be loaded to main memory, but less command don’t load entire file, but load it part by part, which makes it faster.

syntax :



less filename
Note : I’m using dmesg output as input to less command in following examples.

For Example : If you want to read contents of dmesg command, it’s better to use it with less command

dmesg | less

less -F filename

eg. less -F /home/mandeep/test/first.erl
It will not give any output, since file can be displayed in single screen.

less /home/mandeep/test/first.erl
These are contents of above tested file, it can be displayed on single screen.

-module(first).
-export([fib/1]).

fib(X) when X 
    1;
fib(X) when X >= 2 ->
    fib(X - 1) + fib(X - 2).
